# Data Collection Methods

![fig3.jpeg](fig3.jpeg)

The use of structured instruments in quantitative and qualitative research requires standardization of procedure to ensure the replicability of the research to confirm findings. This way, credibility is ensured, and the universality of the proof (model of the phenomenon under investigation) is enforced as long as contrary evidence is not revealed.

Collecting data for a research study can be accomplished in different ways. The data can be collected in written forms through observation and surveys, or in numerical form, such as the number of users who access a software application each day. Additionally, some research variables are by nature numerical (i.e., weight, age, revenue, income), others (i.e., quality, performance, beliefs, and attitudes) might need the development of some scale for their measurement. For the latter category, a questionnaire might be developed where a measure of agreement with a statement (e.g., ‘strongly disagree,’ ‘disagree,’ ‘neither agree nor disagree,’ ‘agree,’ ‘strongly agree’) can be selected by participants. This type of scale will be “assumed” equivalent to a numerical scale (e.g., ‘strongly disagree’ = 1, ‘disagree’ = 2).

## Interviews

Qualitative studies are conducted in natural environments to reflect observable human behaviors in a non-manipulated setting. One of the most frequently used data collection methods in qualitative studies is the interviews. In such a case, the researcher conducts face-to-face interviews with participants, telephone interviews, or engages in focus group interviews with six to eight interviewees in each group. These interviews involve unstructured and generally open-ended questions that are few in number and intended to elicit views and opinions from the participants.

For interviews, one needs to be more attentive in terms of accommodating the identified participants’ choice of location and time unless there are specific reasons for meeting in a specified place and time (i.e., interventions). For other forms of data collection (e.g., observations and archival data), the researcher will have to make arrangements with the site that will provide the data as to how they will be collected.

## Questionnaires

Data collection begins by identifying and inviting a sample of participants to join a research study. In the case of a questionnaire, this might entail publishing it on the Internet (Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or a similar service) and distributing invitations for participation physically (i.e., flyers, advertisements, announcements) and/or online (e.g., social media sites, bulletin boards). Incentives for participation might be considered but should be kept to a minimum as otherwise, it might be considered that they distract from the participation and could also attract unqualified participants. The general practice nowadays is to post questionnaires online so participants can access them through a link included in the call for participation. This approach simplifies the logistics of accessing, submitting, and collecting the data.

## Data Analysis

Most online platforms offer options for easily retrieving the data in the form of tables (i.e., Excel format). This makes it extremely easy afterward to insert the data in statistical analysis software for further analysis.

After the data is collected, researchers may need to screen the data for ineligible entries, missing entries, inconsistencies, impossible data combinations, out of range values, etc. With questionnaires, this is relatively easy given they usually involve selections among existing options (per question) or single entries (for example, age) that could easily be checked in terms of representing participants. At this stage, researchers might also decide if additional classifications/conversions are required. For example, this might include using the same units as having currency in euros or dollars, categorizing entries according to groupings. For example, for age, you might decide that instead of the actual age to provide categories like ‘below 30’, ‘between 30 and 40’, and ‘above 40’. Additionally, transformations might be required before the analysis phase, like when you convert monthly salary to yearly income, normalization of variables, applying formulas, etc.

In cases when data is in a narrative form (like in interviews and open-ended questions), retrieving the appropriate information might require more effort, especially when the information is not expressed in numerical form. For example, themes might need to be identified so that their frequency of appearance might be used as their quantitative representation. The co-appearance or lack of appearance of themes might also be of value to your analysis, so records of such incidents might be retrieved for further analysis.
