> [Introduction]: This study explores the preparedness of our emergency department during the COVID-19 outbreak from the nurses’ perspectives, providing a reference and basis for our emergency department's response to public health emergencies. [Methods]: Using qualitative research methods, semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 emergency nurses who met the inclusion criteria, and Colaizzi analysis was used for data analysis, summary, and induction.

## Quantitative analysis and mathematic modeling of the global outbreak of COVID-19 (2020)

Yanyan Jiang, Xuefeng Jiang, Wenjun Tong, & Jingming Zhou. (2020). Quantitative analysis and mathematic modeling of the global outbreak of COVID-19. Journal of Infection in Developing Countries, 14(10), 1106–1110. [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.3855/jidc.13150). [ModelGlobalOutbreak.pdf](ModelGlobalOutbreak.pdf).

> To better understand the epidemics in different areas, `the progress percentage was generated in this study by dividing everyday total confirmed case number by the up-to-date total case number`, so data obtained from different countries and territories can be put together and compared directly regardless of the large difference in the magnitude of numbers. The global outbreak data were `analyzed and categorized into 4 groups based on different epidemic curve stages`. The grouping pattern suggests that the geographical position may not play a critical role in the progress of COVID-19 epidemic. In this report, we also `used a mathematic model to predict the progress of COVID-19 outbreak` in UK, USA and Canada in Group 3, providing valuable information for assessing the risk in these countries and the timing of reopening business.

### What are the four groups

If we look at an epidemic curve, an epidemic in an area can be divided into 4 stages based on the increase of total confirmed cases:

1. _Stage 1_, sporadic cases or limited local transmission, creating undulating curve;
2. _Stage 2_, substantial local transmission, featuring a takeoff of the curve;
3. _Stage 3_, emerging of large number of new cases, causing an exponential increase;
4. _Stage 4_,fewer new cases reported than peak, leading to flattening of the curve till the end of the epidemic

### What did they conclude

This study is the first to use progress percentage to plot epidemic curve and enables direct comparison of data regardless of the large difference in the magnitude of numbers.

## Forecasting the timeframe of 2019-nCoV and human cells interaction with reverse engineering (2020)

Sohail, A., & Nutini, A. (2020). Forecasting the timeframe of 2019-nCoV and human cells interaction with reverse engineering. Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology, 155, 29–35. [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2020.04.002). [ForecastingCovid.pdf](ForecastingCovid.pdf)

> **Background**: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to the b-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational framework. **Methods**: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. **Results**: A delay differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and control strategies.

### How did they approach the problem

The study begins with an analysis of the virus structure and its relationship to previous outbreaks of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic of 2002 and the MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome) of 2012.  Models from those crisis form the foundation of this predictive construct.

This begins with determining the `Hill function`, which models cell interactions and delays of infection.  Next, the transition probabilities require two important values:

1. Infectious Dose: amount of SARS-CoV2 virus, the host is exposed
to.
2. Incubation Period: time taken by the virus to hijack the target
cells.

These values feed into a Markov Chain that predicts the infection rate and necessary time.

### What are their results

After using different `Hill` constants they could predict the incubation durations of the virus.  This assumes that it follows similar behaviors to SARS and MERS -- as their is no historic COVID data.

Based on these models a person is infectious for roughly 12 days (assuming `b=1`).  This is particularly useful for devising medical processes and response strategies.

## Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 (2020)

Abd El-Aziz, T. M., & Stockand, J. D. (2020). Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status. Infection, Genetics and Evolution, 83. [DOI](https://doi-org.proxy1.ncu.edu/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104327). [DrugDevCovid.pdf](DrugDevCovid.pdf)

1. The authors begin the article with an analysis of how the virus likely spread from bats, to snakes, to humans, to other humans.
2. Next, they review COVID information and how this is becoming a European and North American issue.
3. From here break down the epidemiology into risk rates by age, gender, and nationality
4. Then analysis on methods to prevent the spread take place (e.g., social distancing and decay rates of surface contamination)
