Now that you have explored different research methodologies and data collection methods, it is time to choose the research method you would like to learn more about during the remaining courses in this program. Your selection will help you solidify a research topic of interest and select the next research course in the program, which will allow you to dive deeper into the details of quantitative, qualitative, or constructive research. Hopefully, the method you choose will be the methodology you follow during your dissertation journey.

To help you make the best choice, begin by identifying a problem you frequently encounter in the technology field. Think about how you could gather data about the problem and the research methodology you should follow to properly study the problem.
