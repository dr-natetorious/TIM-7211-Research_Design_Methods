Qualitative research methods reflect an inductive approach to research in which the main focus is to explore and understand human behavior. Qualitative research approaches reflect the assumption that reality is subjective, dynamic, and negotiable. Results from qualitative research reflect themes identified through textual content analysis and interpretation by the researcher. The end product is a narrative report containing contextual descriptions and direct quotations from research participants. Findings are specific to the study context and are affected by the researcherâ€™s subjective interpretation; therefore, they may not always be generalizable to a larger population.

Qualitative studies are conducted in natural environments to reflect observable human behaviors in a non-manipulated setting. One of the most frequently used data collection methods in qualitative studies is the interviews. In such a case, the researcher conducts face-to-face interviews with participants, telephone interviews, or engages in focus group interviews with six to eight interviewees in each group. These interviews involve unstructured and generally open-ended questions that are few in number and intended to elicit views and opinions from the participants.
