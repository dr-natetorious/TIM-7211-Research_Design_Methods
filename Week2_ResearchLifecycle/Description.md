# Scientific Research Lifecycle

![fig2.jpeg](fig2.jpeg)

Academic research operates at two levels: a theoretical level and an empirical level. The former is concerned with building theories to explain and predict social phenomena, whereas the latter focuses on testing the concepts and relationship of theories to gauge how precisely they reflect observations of reality. The goal is to build better theories over time because researchers develop a better understanding of the phenomena under study and add to the body of knowledge. In that sense, research is incremental and oscillates between theory and observations. Research that focuses on inferring theoretical concepts and patterns from data is called inductive, or theory-building, research. By contrast, researchers whose aim is to test concepts and relationships from theories using new empirical data are engaged in deductive or theory-testing research. Both types of research are necessary to advance science because all good theories reflect reality.

In information sciences, theories are rarely perfect due to the imprecise nature of theoretical concepts, the myriad of potentially influencing situational factors, and the inherent issues related to accurately measuring the social phenomena under study. Social science research methods are designed to obtain the best possible results, given the phenomena under study, the stated problem, and the specific research objectives. Common research methods in the social sciences include qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, and action research studies. Regardless of the chosen method, most social science research projects follow a standard sequence of activities, sometimes referred to as the research lifecycle, or research process. This process starts with the identification of a knowledge gap related to a particular phenomenon, statement of the problem and study purpose, articulation of research questions and hypotheses, data collection and analysis, interpretation of the data and conclusions, recommendations, and dissemination of results.

Ethical research includes participant protections, appropriate use of intellectual property, professional conduct, clear communication, and the avoidance of research misconduct (falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism), management of bias, and efforts to ensure the academic integrity of research findings. All researchers and research institutions must be cognizant of conducting research in an ethically sound manner. Research universities have Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in place to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of research study participants. The IRB also monitors the ethical conduct of individual researchers and research teams to prevent misleading data collection practices, intentional and unintentional falsification of data or results, plagiarism, improper data storage practices, and misleading authorship issues.

Each researcher must abide by strict research protocols to help ensure the integrity of the research project and its outcomes. Protocols include specific guidelines for minimizing researcher bias, protecting participants’ identity, obtaining informed consent, quality assurance and control measures, as well as data management procedures and other details on how to document and resolve issues that may raise ethical concerns.
