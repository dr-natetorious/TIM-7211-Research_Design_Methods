## New model of emergency communication for disaster relief in remote areas (2016)

A. E. Aburawi, S. Salic and M. Krampell, "New model of emergency communication for disaster relief in remote areas," 2016 12th International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology (IIT), Al-Ain, 2016, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2016.7880019.

*What is their objective*?

Recently multiple political and natural events have disrupted communication.  These distruptions occur during periods where the reliability of these systems is most critical.  The authors seek a solution that is:

- Easy to use - no advanced administration
- Easy to install - if not already in place
- Cheap to operate
- Long range communication - at least 1000km
- Available for many simulateous users

*What artifacts did they produce?*

- The researchers build a proof-of-concept that relies on one-way short wave radio
- This capability needs to eventually function with existing smartphones or integrate into these products.
- The POC uses an Arduino board with various components to simulate a real smartphone

## Measuring Cybersecurity Wellness Index of Critical Organisations (2018)

H. Jazri, O. Zakaria and E. Chikohora, "Measuring Cybersecurity Wellness Index of Critical Organisations," 2018 IST-Africa Week Conference (IST-Africa), Gaborone, 2018, pp. Page 1 of 8-Page 8 of 8. [MeasuringCybersecurity.pdf](MeasuringCybersecurity.pdf).

The authors introduce a concept of _cybersecurity wellness for Critical Organizations_ and provide a measurement index.  This artifact allows organizations to compare and evaluate against one another more easily.  They can also follow a bottom-up approach to identify map problems and potential solutions.

*What artifacts did they produce?*

The researchers purposefully selected twenty critical organizations that fall within a well-defined criteria.  Next, the group collected data on vital signs and verifiable feature selection.  They coalesce these results into `Ten Trusted Facilitators` that describe the security posture and maturity of an organziation.

*What makes their solution unique?*

Similar studies focus on a top-down analysis of organizations, across 114 vital signs.  They are unique in their bottom-up perspective and focusing on only a subset of the most highest risk areas.  From this subset they can map _security functions_ into a maturity level -- simplifying prioritzation of future efforts.

Those functions are: Identify, Protect, Detect, Response, Recover.  Each is graded from Not Implemented (0) to Very Effective (3).
