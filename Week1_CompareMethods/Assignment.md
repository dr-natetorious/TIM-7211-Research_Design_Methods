# Compare Research Methods

For this assignment, you must compare quantitative, qualitative, and mixed research methods by developing a table that identifies the key characteristics and applications of each method, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.

You must then identify three research articles in a technical field of study that reflects the application of each of the three methods and write a paper that discusses the methodology the authors followed and assess the ethics protocol (if any) involved in each study. Include recommendations for improvements as needed.

## Requirements

Length: 4-5 pages academic paper, not including title page and references. Attach the table as an appendix.

The writing should integrate scholarly resources, reflect academic expectations and current APA standards, and adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.

When applicable, conduct a Turnitin pre-check and then upload your completed assignment and click the Submit to Dropbox button.
